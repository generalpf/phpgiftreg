PHP Gift Registry (phpgiftreg)

The PHP Gift Registry is a web-enabled gift registry intended for use among 
a circle of family members or friends.  

It is intended to fill the following purposes:
x Permit the long-term storage of a list of items one desires, along with 
  its price, where it can be bought, and (optionally) a URL where it can be 
  viewed.
x Enabled items to be "locked" by one shopper so that the same item is not 
  bought by someone else.

Its features include:
x A single unifying view of items on your own list and people whose lists you 
  can view.
x A now-optional request/permit system by which you can control who can see 
  your list.
x A "checkin/checkout" system which allows you to reserve items on someone's 
  list.
x An in-system messaging system by which users can be informed of item 
  deletions or custom announcements.
x New users can request accounts.  Optionally, administrators will be 
  informed about the request, and they can then approve or reject the 
  request.  Either way, the user will be informed by e-mail.
x A site-customizable ranking system for items.
x An events system for users to add significant (read: gift-bearing) events
  which will show up on others' displays when the event nears.

Read INSTALL for installation instructions.
